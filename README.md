# socialPOD Django
### :question: What is it?
socialPOD was the old name for mLIFE, a study designed to help participants lose weight. See more here: [mLifeStudy](https://mlifestudy.org/ "mLifeStudy")

This repo is the old Django version. It has most of the features the study required, such as direct messaging, posts, comments, tagging, notifications, and more. This is to be seen as an archive that can be used as starter code for Django projects with similar interests.

Note that I am not at this moment a UI designer (08/14/22) and as such I focused more on just getting things running. You can check out some images below.
